# Python-projects
1) Solved complex problems with dynamic programming within the complexity required with Python. It involved Floyd Warshall algorithm and implemented backtracking.

2)Solved problem finding the shortest path from start to end and pass through at least one of the given point with Python within the complexity of O (ElogV).The algorithm used is Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and it is implemented with Heap.
